# UTwastewaterARG
Identification of ARGs and MGEs in wastewater metagenomes

This repository contains a complete pipeline for identification of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in metagenomes. It was carried out on a dedicated server in the Brazelton Lab at the University of Utah. 

The batch script "utwaste-pipeline-master.sh" uses an assembly-based approach. 

.... uses an assembly-free approach where ARGs and MGEs (?) are identified directly in unassembled sequence reads.
